Unpure
======

Forked from https://github.com/yahoo/pure.

The fork tries to be less intrusive than pure.css in the sense that native html tags are used instead of pure-classes wherever possible. So `.pure-table` becomes just `table`, `.pure-button` can be `button` or `.button` and so on.

### ToDo
- make it ready for bower
- make it ready for npmjs
